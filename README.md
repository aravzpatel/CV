### Full Stack Developer 
I am a commercial-minded **Full Stack Developer** looking for a role where I can contribute towards business growth by applying my growing technical skills with my innate entrepreneurial approach.

I have been fortunate to have had a great career so far; playing an important role in two of London's fastest growing scaleups (**Swoon Editions** and **Zencargo**). Both of these experiences have helped to hone an **agile**, **growth mindset** that is capable of taking on **challenges**, **breaking down the steps** and **delivering results**. Through these challenges, I have worked closely with product and engineering teams which has driven my desire to work in this area.

In August I completed a 16 week software development bootcamp at **Makers Academy**. This course developed upon the technical skills that I gained studying for an **MSc in Economics at London School of Economics** and operating as an analyst. It also provided me with an opportunity to reflect on my learning process; seek out feedback and try new styles of working. This has given me a **process driven** working style that is **curious to learn about new technologies** whilst **supporting the learning of others**.

**Tech Skills** Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node.js,React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Python, SQL

## Skills

### Commercial Decision Maker
I use an analytical approach to make decisions that have an impact. I seek first to understand the business context; what is the target? Does a £ target exist? Then I use my entrepreneurial skills to evaluate options and choose a strategy, sometimes this may require some excel modelling. Finally I try to reflect on the sucess of the approach to accelerate my growth.

Using these skills has enabled me to bootstrap a retail business that turns over £2.5k per quarter at 40% margins.

### Adaptable Fast Learner
Working in high-growth businesses throws more challenges at you than you can count. I've used those experiences to build a process that gets me up to speed quickly so that I can contribute. I pretty much follow the same strategy: I start with the situation, I break it down into bite-sized pieces, I define objectives, I apply the pomodoro technique.

As a side-project during Makers, I built a React-Rails wedding invitation project. To begin with I had no understanding of React but by applying my process I quickly made headway. This enabled me to apply these skills to our final project and help my team understand this new technology faster.

### Relentless Problem solver
I thrive in situations with a goal and no known methodology of getting to the promised land. I love the challenge of having to think of new ways of doing things and then trying them out. Sometimes they fail, but that’s ok because I’ll learn from them and be better for the next time. 

Working at Zencargo, I saw that we were providing a multi-billion pound client a poor service by failing to provide timely responses to incoming requests. Speaking with the team I deduced that there was no oversight for the process which made it impossible to provide an acceptable standard. To provide the oversight required I spent an afternoon cobbling together a hybradised KANBAN board using Zapier, Google Sheets, Trello, Slack and Email to track incoming requests and check if they had been fulfilled. This flexible approach enabled us to identify missing quotes quickly and improve our response times, which ultimately provided the level of service the client was looking for.

### Design-forward thinker
I believe that good design should always be appreciated regardless of it’s delivery mechanism: visual, physical or technical. I have worked extensively with designers and have learnt how to drive style changes to create aesthetics that deliver impact.

In 3 months, I delivered a re-brand for [Zencargo](https://www.zencargo.com/) that elevated the brand away from the competition. Working with our product and sales team I built our market positioning around the practical value that Zencargo could bring to businesses by moving goods faster. I then collaborated with external designers to build a unique visual language that communicates the practical, tangible impact through blending existing isometric concepts with real-life phototgraphy
blend our existing isometric concept with real-life photography to create a unique visual language.
