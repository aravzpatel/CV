I am a commercial-minded **Full Stack Developer** looking for a role where I can drive business improvement through the application of data.

I am a technology advocate. Having worked in two London's premier scaleups (**Swoon Editions** and **Zencargo**), I've experienced first hand how data and technology can challenge the status quo. During these roles, I have always worked closely with engineering teams to build products, develop messaging and implement solutions. Working in fast-paced businesses has helped me to hone an **agile**, **growth mindset** that is capable of taking on **challenges**, **breaking down the steps**, **thinking entreprenuerially** and **delivering results**. 

In August I completed a 16 week software development bootcamp at **Makers Academy**. This course developed upon the technical skills that I gained studying for an **MSc in Economics at London School of Economics** and operating as an analyst. It also provided me with an opportunity to reflect on my learning process; seek out feedback and try new styles of working. This has given me a **process driven** working style that is **curious to learn about new technologies** whilst **supporting the learning of others**.

**Tech Skills** Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node.js,React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, Python, SQL

## Skills

### Strategic Decision Maker
I use an analytical approach to make decisions that have an impact. I seek first to understand the business context; what is the target? Does a £ target exist? Then I use my entrepreneurial skills to evaluate options and choose a strategy, normally this includes reading articles, processing data and building some form of excel model. Finally I try to reflect on the sucess of the approach to accelerate my growth.

As the sales team at Zencargo grew, I made the decision to move from 1:1 management to a team-meeting based structure. Evaluating different possible types of meeting structure, I decided to create an Agile environment. I made each sales member present a complete list of their live deals with their next steps to progress forward. This enhanced visibility on actions, encouraging more focus and enhacing the management team's ability to swarm over opportunities. As a result we were able to win larger accounts, increasing deal size closure from 250%.

### Adaptable Fast Learner
Working in high-growth businesses throws more challenges at you than you can count. I've used those experiences to build a process that gets me up to speed quickly so that I can contribute. I follow a tried and tested strategy: I start with the situation, I break it down into bite-sized pieces, I define objectives, I apply the pomodoro technique. Sometimes I fail, but that’s ok because I’ll reflect and be better for the next time. 

As a side-project during Makers, I built a React-Rails [Wedding Invitations](https://github.com/aravzpatel/wedding-invitations). To begin with I had no understanding of React but by applying my process I made headway to an mvp in 3 days. This enabled me to apply these skills to our final project and help my team understand this new technology faster.

### Strong Communicator
Communication is the lifeblood of any business. I have worked hard at improving my communication skills for a number of years. Talking simply and practicising empathetic listening have helped me gain the trust of my colleagues. This trust has enabled me to act as a sounding board for ideas; fostering debate and providing support to enable teams to achieve their goals.

A common feedback from my **remote pairing partners** was that they admired *my process*. Part of this is due to my communication skills, without which it would be impossible for them to understand my process. Whilst coding I would use similies to give challenges a practical context. In addition, I would draw diagrams to help my pairs visualise potential solutions and help them to better understand a route to success. 

### Design-forward thinker
I believe that good design should always be appreciated regardless of it’s delivery mechanism: visual, physical or technical. I have worked extensively with designers and have learnt how to drive style changes to create aesthetics that deliver impact.

In 3 months, I delivered a re-brand for [Zencargo](https://www.zencargo.com/) that elevated the brand away from the competition. Working with our product and sales team I built our market positioning around the practical value that Zencargo could bring to businesses by moving goods faster. I then collaborated with external designers to build a unique visual language that communicates the practical, tangible impact through blending existing isometric concepts with real-life phototgraphy to create a unique visual language.
