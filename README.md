## Skills

### Commercial Decision Maker 
I love using an analytical approach to make decisions that have an impact. Throughout my career in high growth businesses I have always sought first to understand business context and then use my innate entrepreneurial behaviour to evaluate options and choose strategies that deliver results.

Using these skills has enabled me to kick-start a retail marketplace business that turns over £1.5k per quarter at 40% margins.

### Adaptable Fast Learner
Time is precious, that’s why I try to get the most out of it. When I’m faced with a problem I like to break down the issue at hand into smaller bite-sized pieces and then tackle them one by one. 

At Zencargo, I was put in charge of handling our Brexit strategy even though I had little technical understanding on trading requirements. Within 3 days I had digested the relevant materials, solving conundrums like whether a UK exporter would need an EORI number in the country they are exporting to (they do), held conversations with experts and developed an actionable plan for us and our clients to execute.

### Relentless Problem solver
I thrive in situations with a goal and no known methodology of getting to the promised land. I love the challenge of having to think of new ways of doing things and then trying them out. Sometimes they fail, but that’s ok because I’ll learn from them and be better for the next time. 

At the beginning of coronavirus, we wanted to help the wider Supply Chain community with free advice on how they could prepare for the changes that were coming. I knew Linkedin was the answer and had a hunch that video could be a solution. The first video I created took 12 hrs to [edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD_LRyxsV0s), my last video took 30 mins to edit and was celebrated for its [quality](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6635923922141405184).

### Design-forward thinker
I believe that good design should always be appreciated regardless of it’s delivery mechanism: visual, physical or technical. I have worked extensively with designers and have learnt how to drive style changes to create aesthetics that deliver impact.

In 3 months I delivered a re-brand for Zencargo that elevated the brand away from the competition. Leveraging an existing isometric concept, I pushed our designers to blend this with real-life photography to create a unique visual language that communicated the practical impact [Zencargo](https://www.zencargo.com/) would provide.
